title: Blogging Intent
---

I’m starting this blog to share some of my thoughts on different technical topics I’ve encountered. My primary goal in this is to further my own understanding by being able to present it in a clear way. In addition it would be great if my blogs were of use to other people’s learning and even better if their feedback allowed me to learn new things.

I recently completed my bachelors of computer engineering in the software option last year. Since then I started working full time at Hermary Opto Electronics as a Software Engineer (EIT). Having finished university I needed to look for ways in which I could continue to improve my technical skills outside of office hours. At first I started with reading more software development books and working on personal projects. The largest change since university occurred when I was reading The Clean Coder and Robert C. Martin suggests using podcasts to expand one’s professional development. Now I do all the time especially as it is so easy to do while commuting to work or exercising. I’m hoping to go over some of the things I learned from reading these books and listening to podcasts in my blog as well as other programming issues I come across. At first I will be writing about some past events in the last few months but I plan to get more current and eventually be posting very recent news.
